# Catalyst + Strapi <br><sub>Storefront Integration</sub>

Integrate BigCommerce's Catalyst storefront with Strapi, to have it manage the built-in blog's content and power a new customer service section. Both with support for i18n, so you can localize the content per locale. Demo data for _en_ and _es_ locales is provided.

This repo houses the Catalyst app. Which renders the storefront using BigCommerce's GraphQL APIs and includes the frontend for the blog and customer service sections of the site.

To run the associated Strapi app you'll want to head to: https://github.com/bigcommerce-labs/catalyst-strapi-backend


## Demo site

For a working demo of this Strapi integration with Catalyst, see the following example:

```shell copy
https://catalyst-with-strapi.vercel.app/blog
```

```shell copy
https://catalyst-with-strapi.vercel.app/customer-service
```

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you need the following:

- Node.js 18+
- Your favorite Node.js package manager, such as `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn` _(these instructions use `npm`)_
- Working knowledge of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- A [BigCommerce store](https://www.bigcommerce.com/start-your-trial/) or [sandbox store](https://start.bigcommerce.com/developer-sandbox/)
- A Strapi instance with the associated Blog and Customer Service content models

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend setting up the Strapi instance *first* since you'll need API credentials as part of this project's .env variables: https://github.com/bigcommerce-labs/catalyst-strapi-backend

## Quick start

Use our Vercel integration to create or link a BigCommerce account to this repo.

It will automatically set the Bigcommerce specific env variables for you.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo: 
```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/bigcommerce-labs/catalyst-strapi-storefront.git
```

2. Install dependences: 
```shell copy
npm install
```

3. Copy the sample .env file so you can edit your local environment variables:
```shell copy
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Follow comments in the .env file to enter the required values: `BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH`, `BIGCOMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `BIGCOMMERCE_CUSTOMER_IMPERSONATION_TOKEN`, and `AUTH_SECRET`. Read through [docs on Catalyst environment variables](https://www.catalyst.dev/docs/environment-variables) to learn more.

5. Copy over the `STRAPI_BASE_URL` and `STRAPI_API_KEY` values from your Strapi instance. If running locally, you probably only need to change the `STRAPI_API_KEY` value.

6. Start Catalyst:
```shell copy
npm run dev
```

7. Head to these pages to see the Strapi integration in action:

- http://localhost:3000/blog/
- http://localhost:3000/customer-service/


> [!TIP]
> Don't see anything there? Keep in mind you need to be running Strapi at the same time as well.
